# Development Process

## 1. Planning
The goal was to build a simple calculator using Python.  
Decisions:
- Use separate functions for each operation
- Use input() to take user values
- Display clear results

## 2. Writing the Code
- Created `calculator.py`
- Defined four functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Added input prompts
- Added error handling for division by zero
- Displayed results based on user choice

## 3. Version Control with Git
- Initialized the repository using `git init`
- Added files using `git add`
- Made meaningful commits
- Pushed code to GitHub

## 4. Documentation
Created:
- README.md
- docs/overview.md
- docs/development.md
- docs/improvement.md
